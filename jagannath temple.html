                    The Jagannath Temple is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannath, a form of Vishnu â€“ one
                    of the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism. Puri is in the state of Odisha, on the eastern 
                    coast of India. King Indradyumna of Avanti has built the main temple of Jagannath at Puri.[1] 
                    The present temple was rebuilt from the tenth 10th century onwards, on the site of pre-existing
                    temples in the compound but not the main Jagannatha temple, and begun by Anantavarman Chodaganga,
                    the first king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.[2] many rumours are spread about the temple but
                    there is no solid proof of it.[3]
                    The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three
                    principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars, Worship is performed
                    by the Bhil Sawar tribal priest in the Jagannath temple.[4] Unlike the stone and metal icons
                    found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced
                    every twelve or 19 years by an exact replica.[5] </p>

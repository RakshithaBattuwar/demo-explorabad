                    religious associations. Sanghi Temple, one of the popular Hyderabad sightseeing places, is also
                    quite famous location for various movie shoots, resulting in its increased popularity.

                    Although the main deity of the temple is Lord Venkateshwara, one can find other important Hindu Gods
                    as well. The idol of Lord Venkateswara is said to be the replica of the one that is in Tirumala.
                    Near the temple of Lord Venkateswara you will find Parvati Temple. Tourists can also find Lord
                    Anjaneya while on the way to the main temple. Another nearby temple houses Lord Shiva along with
